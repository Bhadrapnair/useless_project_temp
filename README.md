### Project Description
[Animal Language Translator üêæ
A fun, interactive web app that ‚Äútranslates‚Äù human English into playful animal sounds for creatures like dogs, cats, cows, chickens, parrots, and more.
Users can type any sentence, choose an animal, see a quirky ‚Äútranslation‚Äù using that animal‚Äôs vocabulary, and hear matching sound effects. Perfect for kids, entertainment, and lighthearted projects, it combines colorful UI, emoji animations, and real audio clips for an engaging experience.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Pet owners are frustrated that they can‚Äôt exchange deep, meaningful life advice with their ducks, confess secrets to their cats, or discuss world politics with their cows. This communication gap is clearly the root cause of most pet-related misunderstandings.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A state-of-the-art ‚Äútranslation‚Äù system that takes your English sentence, converts it into a random-but-fun combination of animal sounds, and plays it back ‚Äî enabling true interspecies non-understanding.]
